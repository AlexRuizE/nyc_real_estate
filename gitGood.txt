Initial Setup
Fork the nyc_real_estate repository 
Clone the FORKED repository onto your machine 
Now it’s time to setup the origin and upstream:
Type git remote -v, you should see 2 “origins” like so:
$ git remote -v
> origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)

Follow the steps here to configure the upstream and origin    
https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork



To synchronize your current state of repo with upstream do 
$ git pull upstream master

To create a branch do:
$ git branch your-branch

Switch to your branch:
$ git checkout your-branch

$ git add files
$ git commit -m “Message”
$ git push

Push all of your work onto your local branch until ready for Pull Request and/or Merge.

To have your local branch show up in remote upstream repo 
 $ git push -u origin your-branch
